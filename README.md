# Gemma CoT Deepseek Distil
Converting a small Gemma model into a reasoning model with Deepseek CoT traces. 

## TODO
- Need to figure out why the reasoning traces are not being included in the output
- Prompts have to be more non-fictional.
- Implement fine tuning.

## Ideas

- Implement progress bar to sythetic dataset creation
- Convert this into a tool w/ a CLI, or a customisable sythetic dataset creation tool
